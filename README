## **mBART for Machine Translation**

This project leverages the power of the mBART (multilingual BART) model for machine translation tasks, with a potential focus on South Asian languages.

**What it Does**

* **Seamless Text Translation:** Effortlessly translate text between various languages, potentially including South Asian languages supported by the mBART model.
* **Multilingual Power (Optional):**  The mBART model, pre-trained on a massive dataset of text and code, enables translation between many languages, including potentially:
    * Hindi (hi)
    * Urdu (ur)
    * Bengali (bn)
    * Tamil (ta)
    * Marathi (mr)
    * Sinhala (si)
* **Interactive Chatbot Interface (Optional):** The project might include a user-friendly chatbot interface for interacting with the translation functionality (if `chatbot.py` exists).

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:**

     * Python 3.x ([link to Python download])
     * Libraries specified in `requirements.txt` (You can install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
     * Transformers library ([link to Transformers library])

2. **Installation:**

   Assuming you have Git installed, follow these steps to clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<repository_owner>/mBART.git
   ```

   Replace `<repository_owner>` with the actual owner of the repository you obtained the code from.

3. **Running the Project:**

   Execute the following command in the project directory to launch the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This command utilizes the `main.py` script. Refer to the project's code or logs for specific functionalities provided.

**Further Exploration**

* **Examine `main.py` to understand how it interacts with other files and utilizes the mBART model.** (Use a slightly smaller font size for body text)
* **Explore `chatbot.py` to learn about the chatbot interface for user interaction and translation integration.** (Use a slightly smaller font size for body text)
* **Review `requirements.txt` to identify the necessary dependencies.** (Use a slightly smaller font size for body text)
* **Investigate `Makefile` to understand the defined automated tasks.** (Use a slightly smaller font size for body text)
