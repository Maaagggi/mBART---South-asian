mBART for Machine Translation
This project leverages the power of the mBART (multilingual BART) model for machine translation tasks, with a potential focus on South Asian languages.

What it Does

Seamless Text Translation: Effortlessly translate text between various languages, potentially including South Asian languages supported by the mBART model.
Multilingual Power (Optional): The mBART model, pre-trained on a massive dataset of text and code, enables translation between many languages, including potentially:
Hindi (hi)
Urdu (ur)
Bengali (bn)
Tamil (ta)
Marathi (mr)
Sinhala (si)
Interactive Chatbot Interface (Optional): The project might include a user-friendly chatbot interface for interacting with the translation functionality (if chatbot.py exists).
